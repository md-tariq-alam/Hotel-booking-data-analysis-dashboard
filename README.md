Title:
Hotel Booking Data Analysis and Visualization (PowerBI)

Objective:
Analyze hotel booking data to assess revenue growth, parking needs, and identify seasonal trends using SQL and Power BI for data-driven decision-making.


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

This project analyzes the following KPIs to assess hotel performance:

1. **Revenue Growth**:  
   - Total revenue by year  
   - Revenue segmented by hotel type (City Hotel vs Resort Hotel)

2. **Parking Utilization**:  
   - Total car parking spaces required by year  
   - Percentage of guests with personal vehicles

3. **Average Daily Rate (ADR)**:  
   - Average daily rate (ADR) by month and year  
   - ADR segmented by hotel type

4. **Total Nights Stayed**:  
   - Total guest nights stayed by year  
   - Nights stayed segmented by hotel type

5. **Seasonality Trends**:  
   - Monthly revenue and ADR fluctuations  
   - Peak and low seasons in bookings

6. **Occupancy Rate**:  
   - Percentage of rooms booked per year  
   - Room occupancy segmented by hotel type
  


### Project Process

1. **Build Database**: Load the hotel booking dataset into a relational database for querying.
  
2. **Develop SQL Queries**: Write SQL queries to extract insights related to revenue, parking, ADR, and trends.

3. **Connect Power BI**: Link Power BI to the database to import and visualize the data.

4. **Visualize Data**: Create interactive dashboards in Power BI to represent the findings.

5. **Summarize Findings**: Analyze the visualized data and document key insights and recommendations.
